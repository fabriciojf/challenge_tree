# Challenge Tree

This project is relative a bynary tree challenge proposal to Vanhack's english course. Here I present my first idea for the solution in Java, without refatoring.

### The problem

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '−', '∗', or '/'. Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.

For example, given the following tree:

```code
      *
    /   \
  +       +
 / \     / \
3   2   4   5
```

You should return 45, as it is (3 + 2) * (4 + 5).
